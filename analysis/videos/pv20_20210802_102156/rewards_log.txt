  1. fell out of plate; took sometime to find. attention to screen; visited lower left area
  2. fell out of plate; ate immediately. investigated piece of scales in the middle. activated led but not enough time before leaving.    
     perhaps it looked for reward afterwards, but not sure.
  3. fell in plate, didn't notice because of screen. finally noticed and went straight to get it (couldn't because of transp. plastic)
     eventually it pushed the plate and moved worm to the middle before eating it.
I 4. now immediately went to eat one. roamed around a lot, eventually went to screen and suddenly jumped exactly to the reinforced location I 5 . no reward but went immediately to the feeder. tried to climb to it. eventually the reward went down! (wonder how and it ate it)
     again with the screen. went to the stone after sniffing lower-left then went straight to location but not long enough (went to screen)
     went to feeder, then screen again.    
  6. fell in plate, it didn't notice. stayed by the screen for a long time then tried to look behind and trigger 
     another one

  8. fell in plate; now started climbing the screen cables, triggering another reward.
