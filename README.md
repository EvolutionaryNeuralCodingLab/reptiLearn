# Reptilearn

__ReptiLearn__ is an open-source software system for building automated behavioral arenas, running closed-loop experiments based on realtime video analysis, and collecting large amounts of time-accurate behavioral data. 

__ReptiLearn__ was created to help us run continuous, long-term, learning experiments tailored to the specific needs and challenges posed by reptile model animals.
